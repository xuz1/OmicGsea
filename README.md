In many omics datasets, such as Illumina DNA methylation data, genes are often represented by variable numbers of correlated probes, and a single probe may map to multiple genes. This complex data structure poses significant challenges for gene set enrichment analysis. The OmicGsea package addresses these challenges by providing both threshold- and ranking-based competitive enrichment analysis methods, effectively accounting for probe correlation and probe number bias. These versatile functions can be applied to a wide range of omics datasets, including DNA methylation, proteomics, genotyping, and genome sequencing. Additionally, the package includes a fast and accurate ranking-based enrichment method specifically designed for gene expression and RNA-seq data.
